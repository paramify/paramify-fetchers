# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) applied
to the contract (see [`docs/versioning.md`](docs/versioning.md)). "The contract"
is the public API surface — the `fetcher.yaml` / category / manifest / envelope
schemas and the `paramify` CLI — not the internal code.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `paramify scripts sync` — push each fetcher's entry script (`fetcher.py` /
  `fetcher.sh`) to Paramify and CONNECT it to that fetcher's evidence set, so the
  tenant records *how* each piece of evidence is generated. A provisioning step
  separate from `paramify upload`: it reconciles the tenant to the repo GitOps-style
  (marker-keyed identity in the script description, `fetcher.yaml` `version` as the
  update signal, a sha256 drift guard). **Scoped to a manifest by default** — it
  provisions scripts only for the fetchers you collect, mirroring how `upload` is
  run-scoped — with `--all` to push the whole catalog, plus `--dry-run` / `--force` /
  `--reassociate` / `--json`. Backed by the `uploaders/paramify_scripts/` uploader.
  Only `SCRIPT` associations are automated; control / solution-capability / validator
  linkage stays Paramify-side.
- [`docs/uploader_design.md`](docs/uploader_design.md) — a dedicated uploader design
  doc covering both built uploaders and the shared evidence-set identity model, and
  a README section + docs-table entries pointing to it.

### Changed

- **TUI Paramify tab redesigned** into stacked *evidence upload* and *scripts sync*
  panels. Scripts sync gained a **Preview** action that runs a read-only dry-run and
  surfaces the per-fetcher plan (create / update / drift / noop) in a table — flagging
  which drifted scripts `--force` would push — and syncs the active manifest's fetchers.

### Fixed

- TUI: page keyboard shortcuts (`ctrl+r` / `ctrl+u` / `ctrl+s`) now fire regardless of
  which control is focused, and default focus lands in the active pane on mount, on tab
  switches (mouse clicks included), and after `escape` — previously they worked only
  right after a number-key tab switch.
- TUI: the *Add fetchers* picker no longer drops a category once all its fetchers are in
  the manifest; already-added fetchers show greyed-out and non-selectable, so a
  fully-added category (e.g. `datadog`) stays visible.
- TUI: the Paramify action row (Preview / Sync Scripts / force / reassociate) now uses
  uniform control sizes instead of content-sized widths and mismatched heights.

## [0.2.1-beta] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- The `deploy/` bundle is now **Docker-only** (Dockerfile + compose + cron) — a
  smaller, less prescriptive deployment footprint for public use.

### Removed

- The Kubernetes deployment manifests and the multi-account hub-and-spoke
  Terraform (`deploy/k8s/`). The Kubernetes *fetchers* (`fetchers/k8s/`) are
  unaffected.

### Fixed

- The containerized deploy no longer defaults evidence uploads to Paramify
  staging; it uses production (`app.paramify.com`), matching the uploader's own
  default.

## [0.2.0-beta] - 2026-07-10

First public release — a beta / pre-release. Pre-1.0, so the contract may still
change before 1.0 (see [`docs/versioning.md`](docs/versioning.md)).

### Added

- Fetcher framework: the `paramify` CLI (list · catalog · describe · manifests ·
  validate · run · runs · evidence · upload · manifest builder) plus the
  `paramify tui` front-end, both talking only to `framework.api`.
- `paramify doctor` — a preflight that checks the Python version, the external
  CLIs each category needs on `PATH`, and (given a manifest) whether its secret
  env vars are set.
- 108 fetchers across 8 categories (aws 79, okta 8, sentinelone 5, knowbe4 4,
  gitlab 3, k8s 3, rippling 3, checkov 2). The AWS category collects where
  deployed via the ambient credential chain, with optional per-target
  profile/region fanout.
- Evidence envelope (`{schema_version, metadata, payload}`, `schema_version`
  `1.0`) wrapped around every fetcher output by the runner.
- Paramify evidence uploader (`uploaders/paramify_evidence/`).
- A containerized deployment bundle (`deploy/`) — a Docker image + compose that
  runs the collector on a schedule and uploads, with secrets injected at run time
  (environment or AWS Secrets Manager).
- A credential-free demo (`demo_hello` fetcher + `examples/demo.yaml`) that emits
  synthetic evidence, so the whole collect → envelope pipeline runs with no cloud
  account.
- KSI metadata: an optional `ksis` array on `fetcher.yaml`, mappings populated
  for 89 fetchers, and `paramify ksi` — a FedRAMP 20x KSI coverage view over
  `api.ksi_coverage()`.
- Optional `validators` metadata on `fetcher.yaml` (regex checks over the
  evidence payload).
- Versioning & contract policy ([`docs/versioning.md`](docs/versioning.md)), this
  changelog, and the manual release runbook
  ([`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md)).

### Changed

- Licensed under GPL-3.0-only.
- Documentation rewritten for public consumption; the README leads with the TUI,
  then the AI-agent path, then the CLI.
- TUI restyled — border titles, status pills, denser controls, and hatched empty
  states.
